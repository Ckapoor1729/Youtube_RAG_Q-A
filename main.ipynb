      "in your eyes where is this warlike situation Israel Iran going to some extent it's a religious issue it's about Muslims of Jews and they are trying to create this pan Turan Corridor which will essentially Wipe Out the nation of Armenia and create a whole turkey Corridor this Iran thing came up the Gaza Israel thing is already going on what do you think the mood is like in that Nation Gaza has been sealed off Palestinians obviously want Israel to cease to exist but long term there is this deep hatred which is like a blood hatred what's been India's stand on both these conflicts India's borders are likely to change in some way in which direction I would not like to talk about it he said it already what's happening on a global scale Europe is in recession people are worried in Europe that Putin may have expansionist Ambitions and would want to take Poland Hungary there's a cold war happening in Africa as well drone Warfare is now an out andout reality it's gone from being something theoretical 5 years ago to being a reality now a whole new level of warfare is coming up people imagine China is the second most powerful Nation they simp are a powerful economy but look at how many nuclear weapons they have this much look at how many nuclear weapons the Russians have they have enough nuclear weapons to annihilate the world if they want they can squash China tomorrow abijit chavas back for a geopolitics special here we go [Music] abijit Chava is back uh you're the only guest who's been a part of almost all our Studios barring the first ever one but that's a testament to your knowledge and how many podcasts are buried inside you uh welcome back sir thank you so much great to be back always great to be back on TRS no always great to host you here uh this is now become an extension of the conversations we have anyway yes but when it comes to these geopolitical conversations I think people really enjoy the flavor of this combination that we have so should we just Deep dive straight in let's do it yeah okay people watch these episodes of TRS from an educational perspective but also from a perspective of knowing the future a little bit um should we begin with Israel Palestine or should we begin with Israel Iran let's begin with the Middle East and there's a whole lot going over there lot to unpack so the current crisis I mean the Middle East is always in crisis if you look at the past 70 80 years of History the Middle East is always in crisis but the current crisis begins somewhere around what was the date October 7 when Hamas launched this massive strike on Israel the this massive terrorist attack on Israel they cut the wires which cut off Gaza from the rest of Israel and they broke through and they massacred more than a thousand Israeli civilians which is clearly a terrorist attack it's a human rights atrocity and whatever you want to call it and Israel was clearly caught off guard by what happened they had no idea this was going to happen big intelligence failure human intelligence signals intelligence whatever other kind of intelligence huge failure from Israel's perspective and this was ex almost exactly on the 50th anniversary of the previous biggest failure in Israel's intelligence history which is the Yum kipur War so this happens Israel is got off guard they do not send in reinforment reinforcements quickly enough and this Massacre end shoes and then Israel gets its act together and launches this massive military attack on the Hamas positions in Gaza and uh well people are saying it's a humanitarian crisis which it is because civilians are being affected but when you do such a thing a terrorist attack of that that magnitude you're going to have something coming back to you so uh that's the situation uh that we have now that is the beginning of the Israel Hamas War which is still continuing and Gaza has been to a significant extent being been devastated people have died the the Hama see Israel tried to implement what we call a two-state solution in the Year 2005 when they uh made Gaza separate and gave the people of Gaza their own government they could elect whoever they want and the people of Gaza El select they decided to vote for Hamas and Hamas is uh an out andout anti-israel organization and they've been building tunnels and they've been stockpiling arms and ammunition and thousands of rockets and all that that so that's where all of this has brought us to so that is the war now even hisbah has been involved hisbah is based out of Southern Lebanon which is a nation to the North of Israel so Israel's northern border is kind of warm it's not exactly hot right now but there is some exchange of fire and all going on on a reasonably regular basis so in the North of Israel you have this this involvement of hisbah and Hamas and hisbah are both said to be proxies of Iran now Iran is the other big Power in the Middle East in in the West Asia region it is an ancient Nation an ancient civilization and since 1979 it's been very strongly anti-israel anti- us 1979 you had the Islamic revolution that happened in Iran Iran became a Theocratic Nation uh the Islamic Republic of Iran was was formed after 79 and the political uh Elite of isra of of Iran the political class they are of the opinion that Israel has no right to exist and when you have that attitude obviously you're going to have a very hostile relationship with that nation and the US is also uh because of the events of 79 very strongly anti-iran because they took these American diplomats hostage for a very long period of time and they stormed the embassy and all that old history at its core is this a religious issue between Iran and Israel I don't think it's a religious issue it's about U well to some extent it's a religious issue because the Jew I mean it's it's about Muslims versus Jews and the support that Iran as a Muslim nation has for the Palestinians who are also Muslims against what they call is Jewish operation and all that but beyond that I mean that's the first level that we can look at beyond that below that there is the power projection angle Iran is a geopolitically ambitious Nation they have these rich reserves of energy which can make that nation very prosperous but they have been under very strong us sanctions for a very long time which has devastated the nation to a significant extent but they still have this memory of being a great Empire the Persian Empire and they would very much like to have that again uh and there are other states or nations in in the neighborhood that are kind of anti them Saudi Arabia has been a US Ally for a very long time uh the UAE is also a US Ally Iraq used to be a us Ally during the time of Saddam Hussein and there was this proxy war the Iran Iraq conflict in the 1980s so Iran is a nation that feels like it's surrounded by enemies but they also have these proxies far a field far beyond their borders hisbah Hamas they have the huis in Yemen they have lots of let's say proxies once again in the nation of Iraq once again that could be because of the religious angle because Iraq is more than 50% Shia and so on so Iran is playing this game they want to project power beyond their borders they would like to reestablish maybe the Iranian Empire the Persian Empire and they are also in the process of developing a nuclear deterrent so uh the Americans and other nations had come to this agreement with with Iran it was called The jcpoa Joint comprehensive plan of action by which within which the Iranian nuclear program would be capped and it would be only used for civilian purposes but Mr Donald Trump walked out of it unilaterally in 2017 or 2018 the viewers can check out the date after that Iran has been free to once again start enriching uranium hexafluoride through its Cent refuges and uh you know creating more uranium enrich highly weapons grade uranium more than 90% pure uranium that you can use in nuclear weapons so Iran as of today May probably have sufficient facile material nuclear facile material to perhaps construct a few cudim nuclear bombs and that is something that worries Israel a lot because Israel also is a nuclear weapons power and unstated nuclear weapons power but it's believed to have about let's say 90 or 100 nuclear warheads so there is all these Dynamics happening in the region there's also the Turkish angle north of Iran you have the nation of aeran which is a very strong Turkish Ally or proxy and they are trying to create this pan Turan Corridor which will essentially Wipe Out the nation of Armenia and create a whole turkey corridor from Turkey in the west all the way to turkistan and other turky nations in the East Central Asia region which is something that Iran would not like to see happen even the Americans would not like to see this happen even the Russians don't want this so there's a whole lot going on the Middle East is always a very complicated region but you have that and then what happens on April 1 this year is Israel allegedly launches an air strike on the Iranian Consulate in Damascus the capital of Syria now Syria has been under siege for the past decade and a half the Americans tried to effect regime change they tried to remove Mr al-assad from power but the Russians stepped in Mr Putin stepped in and ensured that this government does not fall out of power and Syria is it's kind of a fragmented Nation if you go to the Far East of Syria there are a couple of US military bases on Syrian territory so the whole of the nation is not under the government's control but Syria also is let's say a Russian proxy and there's Iranian involvement there as well so Russia Iran and to some extent China are working together in the Middle East region to offset the US allies in the region so there's a cold war kind of process happening which kind of sometimes spills out into hot Warfare so the the Israelis bomb the Iranian cons in Syria which is clearly a violation from any perspective of international law now the Iranians were put in this conundrum what do you do if you don't respond you lose all credibility and and your allies will be afraid to trust you after that so they had to respond so then later that later this month in April I don't remember which date 13 14 something like that the Iranians launched a massive strike on Israel a whole bunch of drones were first launched then they launched Cru missiles and ballistic missiles but it was done in such a way it was choreographed in such a way that all these assets will arrive in Israel at the same time so first you have to launch the slow moving uh offensive weapons which are the drones now those become very clearly visible on radar and all that so the Israelis knew this is coming and then they were able to take out most of this so the Jordanian uh Jordanian government got involved they took out some of the missiles and drones the Saudis got involved they also took out some of the missiles and drones and the rest of these missiles and Dres were neutralized by the Israeli Iron Dome system and some of the missiles Etc they did impact some Targets in Israel overall not a lot of damage but a massive number of assets were deployed against Israel so this had a couple of effects first of all it did not do a lot of damage in Israel it was choreographed in such a way that the Israelis could see it coming but the Iranians got to see exactly which nations act in which Manner and what are the kind of defenses they have and once again the isra the Iranians did not have to spend a lot of their stockpile it was just a fraction of what they have in reserve so that's what happens then the Israelis obviously they are now in a position that if we don't retaliate we will lose face we will lose credibility so they also launched a retaliatory air strike on certain Iranian targets a few days later some uh military assets were kind of damaged or destroyed but overall the Iranians have claimed that there's been no significant damage and the situation seems to have calmed down right now the main problem is that the two Nations it's very hard for them to go to war because the borders of the two nations are about 1,000 km apart and the major cities are about 2,000 km apart so how do you fight a war unless you get the US involved the US has military bases in the region south of Iran across the Persian Gulf and all that but we don't want a war there because a significant amount of the world's energy flows out of the Persian Gulf and if Iran is is a is in a state of war and they are a reasonably capable military power they have very good drones and whatnot then they are in a position to close off the poran Gulf by the straight of hormos and that would make oil prices globally shoot up which will destroy so the economy of some Nations and it will be overall bad for the global economy so we don't want a war there so that's where we are right now VAV the middle east region the huis the Anar Allah faction in in Yemen are also involved in targeting various Israeli you know ships and all that there are Somali pirates involved in the in the Western Indian Ocean region the Indian Navy is currently conducting freedom of navigation operations in this region especially Visa the Somalian pirates so that there is a reasonable amount of navigation and the overall economic order is not affected too badly so that is the situation right now the Middle East is more tense than normal now the two nations want go to war it doesn't look like that but there's going to be let's say asymmetric Warfare between the two Nations which means proxies will be will be involved in some way the mosad could could carry out assassinations of various hypothetically could carry out assassinations of various Iranian targets Within Iran the Iranians could use their proxies in various Nations to attack Israel in various ways there could be cyber warfare and whatnot so the situation is not normal it's way more tense than normal but hopefully we won't have a hot War that's where we are we are the Middle East the West Asia region ah really where do we go with this conversation though let's talk about something else Maldives there's so much happening right now look there's there's Maldives which is acting up against India there is that there's always the India China issue the India Pakistan issue China and Russia things are not entirely well between them there is Ukraine that's happening Ukraine the Ukraine war it's still going on uh Europe is in recession things are not good for the European economy people are worried in Europe that Putin may have expansionist Ambitions and want would want to take Poland Hungary much more next there are people who are fear-mongering about that there is East Asia which is Japan South Korea North Korea Russia and China there's the Taiwan angle there's so much that's happening there's a cold war happening in Africa as well okay let's come back to Iran and Israel okay because this was good context about what's happening on a global scale but while you were talking about Iran you said that they have geopolitical Ambitions yes in today's day and age what does geopolitical Ambitions mean other than expansion of land and or expansion of bank accounts yeah so geopolitical Ambitions means that you want to have more power projection in a variety of ways beyond your borders Iran obviously I mean at the end of the day you want your borders also to change and you want to grab more territory if you look at historical Persia it was much greater than what it is today where did it SP uh the Caucasus region used to be under Persian control the whole of present day Turkey was once under the control of the Persian Empire okay uh Alexander once he started expanding eastwards two and a half th almost 2,300 years ago he went into Persian H Hill territory which is current present day Turkey so the Ian the Persian Empire extended all the way to Turkey and Central Asia parts of Central Asia the Caucasus region so obviously at some level in your mind you will feel that these are our lost territories and at some point in the future you may you may Harbor hopes of getting those back again and the people of of the Caucasus region they are kind of you could say they practice what is what you could call Iranian culture the languages are like the oian language otic language are schian languages skan derived languages which are considered to be iranic languages and all so you have all that there aand Iran aand Iran yes sir aand Iran turkey wants aun turkey there's a whole lot happening in the region you know so yeah so Iran is geopolitically ambitious it's it even though right now the the borders may not be in a position to change they want to be able to influence events beyond their borders in Nations like Ira Iraq for example they would like the US to leave Iraq they would like to have a pro-iran government in Iraq obviously a Shia regime they would like to see Saudi influence reduce in the region American influence reduce in the region more Iranian influence which means the entire neighborhood becomes more favorable for Iran and then let's see how it goes in the future so that's what I mean by geopolitically ambitious and geopolitically active I mean India look at India gigantic Nation sub subcontinent size Nation but our neighbors see how they behave against India they are all trying to bite back at India whether it is Nepal who is using the China factor or Maldives who is using the China factor or whatever in the case of Iran it's different Iran has active assets within Iraq within Yemen even as far as Gaza as far as Lebanon even in Syria so they are active Way Beyond their borders the way we are not so much more Geo geopolitically ambitious and active Nation compared to a nation like India which has in the past 10 years India has changed but beyond before that it was like a soft State anybody could come and punch us and we would just turn the other cheek Iran is not that sort of nation that's what I mean by geopolitically active and ambitious do you think we'll ever see an expansionist India in our lifetimes in our lifetimes it may happen really it may happen in our life lifetimes it's possible I'm obviously asking you this question based on the fact that we've done countless geopolitical episodes together and the one core learning I've had about geopolitics from you is that geopolitics unfolds over decades so you can kind of roughly predict what is likely to happen so two questions one I'll come back to this question about India being an expansionist country do you see us going in that direction and two whatever is happening with Iran Israel now did you think that this is what is going to un fold in the Middle East like what was the version of this in your head before this Iran Israel thing happened it happened completely unexpectedly see uh I look at probabilities I don't try to make predictions so right now what's the probability of a conflict in this region I look at based on the power based on the balance of power of various Nations I have constructed what I call it's not released yet but by the time this episode comes out it may be released it's called the chavda index of hard power so every nation you can actually construct a hard power score based on a number of factors so the US in my index it's the first Indian index of geopolitical power okay in the in in this index the US gets about 94 out of whatever score it is the next most powerful nation is Russia which is above 50 then you have China which is around 15 and then India is fourth at 4.9 so the top four nations are the US the sole superpower second is Russia which is the near superpower third is China at which is like far below Russia a great power and you have a local a regional power like India so every geographical region let's say the West Asia region you know what is the hard power score of each nation and then it tells you what is the balance of power and power is a weird thing it exerts pressure outwards the larger your hard power score the more pressure you can expand you can exert outside and beyond your borders it's like a physical Force so in Asia if you look at the balance of power you have Russia the most powerful nation which is a Eurasian Nation then you have China and then you have India these nations and there's a whole balance of power based on which nations are competing against whom So based on that if you look at West Asia you have Iraq which no longer is hard power because the US took it over after the you know after the invasion last Invasion and you have two major powers in the West Asia region which is Israel and Iran now if you look at that they they reasonably well balanced so something happened and somebody made a plan that we're going to kind try to to offset or upset the balance of power and that's how this Hamas War happened it's not something that I had ever predicted it is not something I had expected but it happened and it it caught everybody on off guard so it is not something that I had expected would happen but yeah that's a kind of volatile region where anything can happen any time and there are certain flash points in the world which you have to keep a close eye on the West Asia region is a flash point it's always a flash point India Pakistan a flash point India China is a flasho South China see Taiwan it's a flas point and East Asia North Korea South Korea that's a flas point and you have a flas point in Europe as well the Ukraine conflict and whatever is happening over there so these are the ma major flash points I sure I have not missed anything out there so things can go wrong in these places somebody miscalculates somebody does something stupid or somebody does something something unexpected and you can have a whole chain reaction that comes out of it so yeah so I had not expected that the Hamas war will suddenly start October 7 it is something that came out of the blue when it comes to India's potential future expansionism I say it could happen within our lifetimes the next 20 to 30 years or whatever because power is a force that ex that that pushes outwards and India is a rising power India is currently a middle power it is not comparable to China China is about three to four times more powerful overall than India but China is a China's hard power is not Rising it is stagnant and it's going to slowly start shrinking over time because of the impending and ongoing accelerating demographic disaster in China which is the horrifically low total fertility rate 1.09 to have a sustainable population at at the the level it is you need a TFR total fertility rate of 2.1 when you go below that what happens is that your population not only starts shrinking the average age the median age of your population starts Rising China's average age is about 39 right now by 2050 it will be in the late 40s 48 or so by 2100 the average age will be 68 69 in China and the population will be half of what it is today long-term China is doomed okay from that perspective who's going to fight the wars at the borders if the average gu is average person is 68 69 years old even in 2050 the average person will be almost 50 years old who's going to fight and China is such a weird Nation where every I must have said this before every person you don't every individual who who lives in China most of them they have no brothers or sisters they have no cousins they have no uncles they have no aunts they are the last of a very ancient lineage and you have a guy like that on the on the border and you expect him to die his entire bloodline will die with him you think they're going to be motivated to fight okay they will obey the orders to go and fight and die if they are told to but the motivation is going to be less compared to somebody who's defending their Homeland like Indians so yeah so that's that's a deal with China India on the other hand is rising its hard power is rising economic power is rising when your economic power Rises and grows your military power Also Rises India's power projection abilities are visible we are doing freedom of navigation operations in the Indian Ocean region the Chinese Navy even though it's so massive they're building warships like sausages they are constrained by the two Island chains the Americans have ring fenced the Chinese Navy through these Island chains so China overall its power projection and its overall hard power is slowly shrinking now it's beginning to shrink it's still going to be a very powerful Nation until the 2050s but overall it's shrinking India on the other hand is rising it's growing the hard power score is rising every year it's going to rise to a certain extent to a certain amount so once you have that happening borders change borders are never set in stone and as your hard power index is rising your score is rising borders will change and expand outwards not inwards so that's why I say that in our lifetime India's borders are likely to change in some way and India's overall net area will increase most likely in which direction I would not like to talk about it because it is not U nice to say but it it will eventually happen you said it already I think those who can understand can understand Northwest that direction uh where do we Okay a bunch of things to unpack um why did you say 2050s for China like that you're saying that based on the demographic the demographic trend predictions yes okay my question is about the two ongoing warlike situations we see one in Israel and Gaza and the second one Ukraine and Russia what have we learned about modern day war from these two situations oh yes lot because War also evolves uh I'm sure there's been a cyber angle but specifically what so yeah that's a great question what can we learn about 21st century Warfare from the conflicts we have seen thus far in the 2200s 22000 so I was recently I we spoke off screen that I was reading rereading stuff about the first and second world wars and you you kind of seeing something similar over here when the first world war happened a lot of technologies that had never been used used before were all ruled out and used in Warfare we are seeing something similar right now so let me talk about first of all a war that very few people have paid attention to the first Armenia aeran war that happened in I think the year 2020 the second nagaro kabak or artak conflict 2020 you saw the use for the first time of loitering Munitions these drones that fly around for two three hours and then suddenly go and attack and these are suicide Munitions which means the Drone will kill itself so it will go and hit a tank when it when it comes to tanks tanks are very heavily armored vehicles the weak spot of any tank is the top and these drones will fly around for hours and when these guys least expect they will come and drop down like kamikaza bombers on top of the tank and they take out tanks and tanks have been taken out in such vast numbers in that conflict the Armenia aeran conflict and now in the Ukraine conflict as well so it's a whole new dimension of warfare we are seeing these little these little weapons these drones the these lering drones and even anti-personnel drones which take out one person or two people it's like a f flying hand grenade it will chase a soldier around and once it is like near enough it will explode it will delate and it's just a small determination like a single hand grenade but it can kill or MIM three or four people at at a given time so we are seeing this very new kind of warfare autonomous weapon systems that think on their own that don't always need inputs from the remote controlling person far away and they can take decisions on their own we are beginning to see the the the influence of AI in this you know very very rudimentary AI systems B put on a chip on a drone and this drone can go and kill um whoever it wants to kill on its own sometimes so we are seeing this happening a whole new level of warfare is coming up uh tanks could become obsolete if sufficient number of drones are available uh drones are pretty cheap compared to tanks a tank will be a few million dollars a drone is what $1,000 $2,000 when it comes to uh the drones that that Iran launched against Israel uh one of those drones May cost a, $2,000 and the uh Iranian Iron Dome defense anti aircraft defense anti- missile defense system each missile costs in in in excess of a million dollars so take so to take out a 55,000 $110,000 drone you have to use a missile that cost a million dollars it's not going to work you launch of drones the missiles the economics just doesn't work and ion doome is basically a region where missiles can intercept flying objects right yeah it's a yeah it's a system it's not a region it's a system that the Israelis have developed it's a very sophisticated system in which you take out flying objects with missiles whether it's a ballistic missile that's incoming towards you whether it's a cruise missile that's that's coming towards you whether it's a fighter plane that's coming towards you or whether it's a drone this system is very sophisticated and it can take out with very high accuracy these incoming threats but each rocket that you are launching is very sophisticated very expensive costs more than a million dollars and if Israel if Iran launches 2,000 cheap drones is going to saturate the system it's a numerical certainty so you can always defeat a system like that that's a problem what I fear is the possibility that the world of drones brings to the world of terrorism mhm because these are relatively cost effective to make yes which effectively means means that every country if possible will have to build some kind of an Iron Dome to guard themselves against drone Warfare yes so all in all drone Warfare is now an out andout reality it's gone from being something theoretical 5 years ago to being a reality now yes but it changes the Dynamics of warfare completely completely and I would also assume that Israel is once again leading the race when it comes to Hardware I'm sure they are they have a very sophisticated Nation technologically they are the Forefront of lots of Technologies what do you think people in Israel are feeling about all this now this Iran thing came up the Gaza Israel thing is already going on what do you think the mood is like in that Nation I think the Israelis are very resilient very hardy people they have always been under a a state of Siege from the time Israel was formed in 1948 the first thing that happened was everyone all of their neighbors attacked them the first war so they have always been under this state of Siege and they have done a lot a tremendous amount of of uh prog press out of almost nothing so uh everybody under goes uh military training compulsory military training unless you have some some uh health issue or whatever but almost everybody goes through that so they all have this Warrior mindset and uh I think I'm sure there is a significant amount of paranoia let's say or the feeling that everyone is out to get us in Israel but it's not something that's new for Israel they have gone through this multiple times in their past they've had multiple Wars the Yom kipur War the 48 war and other Wars and there have been smaller conflicts also that can be classified as Wars and so on so it's not something very new to them but obviously it's it must be for for someone like you and me it'll be very strange to live in that sort of society where there's the constant threat of annihilation that everyone's out to get us all of our neighbors they don't like us right now they may be behaving themselves but at the end of the day all of us all of them want to kill us so yeah it's strange in your eyes where is this Israel Iran and or Israel Palestine thing going I don't see what the solution is look there have been multiple solutions that have been proposed a three-state solution two-state solution whatever the two-state solution is Israel gives some territory exclusively for the Palestinians to live in and you live separately we live separately we don't bother with your life you don't bother with our life and we go our separate ways you have your territory you govern yourself so that has actually been implemented in 2005 when Gaza became self-governing and the people of Gaza voted Hamas to power and we know what happened after that so the Israelis have tried a two-state solution and see what happened October 7 2023 a massive terrorist attack and the there are people in Gaza who were crossing the border every day and working in Israel they had employment in Israel they were working in in various roles in various places some of them were working as uh I don't know what gardeners or whatever in various homes cleaners and they are the ones who gave intelligence to the terrorists as to what are the vulner vulnerabilities in each of these homes in each of this kbim and all so now that is gone the trust whatever little trust was there has been annihilated destroyed those people will never get employment in in is Israel again Gaza has been sealed off so what happens now I I am at a loss as to imagine what the long-term solution to this problem is I don't know I mean the the Palestinians obviously want Israel to seize to exist Iran wants Israel to seize to exist they say that from The River To The Sea Palestine will be free which means no Israel the river that they're talking about is the Jordan River which is the de facto border between Israel and the nation of Jordan from there to the militarian Sea you have the small nation of Israel from The River To The Sea if Palestine is free it means there is no Israel left so that is obviously a call for the uh Erasure of a nation and the genocide of a people now obviously that is something that no civilized person would want anywhere in the world so that's not a viable solution but then the Palestinians said that the Israelis are oppressing us well the Israelis gave them a separate nation essentially in Gaza and the Israelis were no longer interfering in what was happening in Gaza but the Palestinians were not okay with that so I don't know the Palestinians would like the complete destruction of Israel the Israelis just want to they also I me they are not entirely All Saints themselves there is the West Bank region which in which they have been settling people maybe they should not do that certainly they should not do that and so on so both sides have done something or the other wrong the terrorist attack on October 7 was an unforgivable thing which a crime against humanity but the palestin would say that the Israelis have been conduct committing crimes against humanity I don't know I am an outside external Observer Observer I don't have a horse in that race but I am not able to see a solution beyond the annihilation of one nation or another which nobody wants so yeah it's it's it's a situation it's a problem that seems to have no solution both want the annihilation of the other kind enough both have wanted the annihilation of the other historically as well but it's never ended yeah so what do you do about this could we see an end uh the end would not be a very nice end you know it so so I don't know the the only thing I can see which is viable is a continuation of the status quo Gaza remains sealed off from Israel no person from Gaza no Palestinian is allowed into Israel the West Bank maybe Israel should completely withdraw but then there's the question of Jerusalem which is part of the West Bank and all that so lots of uh very very complicated uh issues over here that have to be fixed Gaza can be simply sealed off and they can live their life the way they want they can receive whatever Supply they want from the sea and that sort of thing that's one reasonably Simple Solution the West Bank is more complicated maybe Israel should St should stop settling people in the West Bank when regions where the Palestinians claim that it's their land and all so I think both sides can make some some uh some efforts to diffuse the situation but long term there is this deep hatred which is like a blood hatred and I don't know what the what the solution to that is uh you know you said that basically the way the Iranian missile and drone strike was planned was simply to kind of test Waters it was like putting a foot in a pond and seeing okay how does Israel and its allies react to this situation so you said that Jordan responded by helping Israel and uh Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia yeah what do you have to say about Jordan and Saudi Arabia well it means that these are both us allies and Israel is the number one US Ally in the region so the American an see when it comes to sovereignty there are only four Sovereign nations in the world the way I see it the US China Russia and India the other nations all have compromised sovereignty or pooled sovereignty when it comes to the West Asia region Israel you can say is a more or less Sovereign Nation to a large extent but Nations like Jordan Saudi Arabia the UAE they have military bases on their soil which are American bases and when you have foreign soldiers foreign troops on your soil you're not really a Sovereign Nation so these nations to a large extent are controlled by the US and they will do what the US what the Americans tell them to do so if they are instructed to defend Israel against of whatever incoming air strike or whatever strike they're going to do it so that is something the Iranians were able to possibly predict and definitely discover that the jordanians and Saudi Arabians will Aid Israel despite being Islamic Nations which are kind of you would imagine antical to the Jewish Nation but there you have it that's what happened and the isra the Iranians also did not want to cause a of damage they wanted to Plate their public their citizenry that look we took this strong action and we have destroyed so many targets the Israeli said very little was destroyed but the Iranian government can claim that we launched X number of assets and destroyed why y amount of assets on Israeli territory so it was at the same time designed to impress their own domestic public to demonstrate their the Iranian capabilities to the rest of the world especially to Israel and to the us and also cause as little damage as possible in Israel and the Israelis responded in in a very similar manner they wanted to demonstrate that we can launch strikes directly on Iranian soil from outside of Iran but they also uh calibrated the strike in such a way that it doesn't cause too much damage so they are both trying to diffuse the situation while Saving Face and not losing credibility marketing gimmicks geopolitical marketing gimmicks you could say that uh okay um do you want to move on to Russia Ukraine because this seems like a situation that's almost over I don't is it unfolding H it is still unfolding and there's a it's a very dangerous flash point actually so what's happen let's talk about that so what's happening in in Ukraine there's not been much news coming out of Ukraine for quite a while here is the current situation Russia is in control of about between a fifth and a quarter of the nation of Ukraine okay it's it's a fluid situation the lines on the front lines are changing here and there but overall Russia has taken control of roughly a fifth to a fourth of the nation of Ukraine their forces are in the ascendancy it's a it's it's What's called the classic long War situation long War scenario in which both sides have S they are there and they know it is going to go on as long as it takes the Russians are very patient they have the the Ukrainian armed forces have been devastated they have essentially lost all the much of their young men then they had to resort to pressing middle-aged guys 50y old 55 year old guys into battle and then they have been forced to even press pregnant women into battle that's been caught on camera such ladyes surrendering to the Russians and that sort of thing so Ukraine has been demographically devastated the flower of Youth has been destroyed especially the men uh that's where Ukraine is so Ukraine is merely a proxy conflict Ukraine is the current F that the West is using to hopefully try from their perspective to to weaken Russia it's not worked it's not worked Russia has gotten better as time has progressed as they always do in historical conflict initially they don't do very well but then over time they get better and better and better the 1940s is a classic example of that initially they were devastated by operation Barbarosa but then they started pushing back and they pushed all the way back to to Berlin so right now Putin wants to wait this out okay that's very become very clear if they want they can flatten Ukraine tomorrow they have enough fire power air power and all that to completely flatten Ukraine tomorrow but they don't want to do that so eventually what's going to happen in Ukraine is Ukraine is going to be partitioned possibly along the ner river which flows through Kiev or in whatever other way whenever it ends this conflict it may either be a frozen conflict or a negoti to settlement to the conflict but it's going to end on Russia's terms now here's the danger in Ukraine somebody gets the genius idea of putting NATO boots on the ground in Ukraine that's going to be a provocation that the Russians will not ignore because Ukraine has been their Red Line a red the Ukraine conflict started because the NATO forces because NATO was pushing eastwards all the way inexorably towards Russia and then Russia was faced with the prospect of having NATO forces and NATO nuclear weapons right on their border and that's why the Ukraine conflict had to be triggered off by Putin starts with the Crimea conflict Crimea war in 2014 was it and then what happened in 2022 so if see M Mak the French president has been saying that we will send French forces to fight alongside the Ukrainian forces in in Ukraine well Mr Putin is not going to just sit and sit back and let that happen so that's going to be a significant escalation if if NATO forces have boots on the ground in Ukraine right now it looks like they're already sending people military personnel as so called military advisers in Ukraine so not in an official formal combat capability but as advisers that's how the Vietnam War started okay if you go back to that period of time the Americans were sending military personnel as so-called military advisers and political advisers to help the north vietn the the South Vietnam government against the North Vietnam government The South was Pro us the north was Pro China that's that's a deal that's how the whole thing started they seem to be doing something similar right now in Ukraine so the next stage of escalation is it's no longer Russia versus Ukraine it's now Russia versus Nato now that again is not yet as bad a situation as you can imagine because NATO is under NATO control NATO command it's not under the US US command but in if even that escalates further and you have Russia versus the US well now we are talking about World War I what is World War I people talk about World War I every day from my perspective World War II is when the top two Powers come directly in there's a direct conf confrontation between the top two Powers which is the US and Russia people imagine China is the is the second most powerful Nation they simply are a powerful economy but look at how many nuclear weapons they have this much look at how many nuclear weapons the Russians have they have enough nuclear weapons to annihilate the world they have the world's largest nuclear Arsenal the Americans come second so Russia is a very powerful defensive power if they want they can squat China tomorrow if they want they have that sort of fire power the Chinese are nothing compared to Russia Russia is far ahead of China in terms of hard power so for my perspective World War III means the US and Russia fight directly and we don't want that to happen and Ukraine is the one flash point in the world where you could have that happen that's why Ukraine it may seem like nothing is happening there but it's a very dangerous thing that's going on right now and what's been India's stand on both these conflicts because publicly we do give a bit of a diplomatic stand I'm also asking you the one layer deep geopolitical angle give both the public and the layer version okay so the public uh Viewpoint and perspective and stand of India is that war is bad this is not the time for war Mr Modi has been saying that since 2022 I believe even when the last time Mr Putin came to India for the India Russia annual Summit uh Mr Modi said in public that this is not a time for war so so India's stand has been consistent in this matter public stand that any conflict that's going on right now there needs to be a diplomatic solution to that please stop fighting go and sit across the across the table and negotiate a reasonable settlement which is you know both can accept that so that applies to to Israel versus Hamas it also applies to Russia versus Nato in Ukraine and maybe Mr zalinski and Mr Putin or their their intermediaries can come together and maybe the N what ever and work it out talk it out find a diplomatic solution that is has been India's official and consistently official position one layer deep well it would not be incorrect to say that India has to some extent benefited from the Ukraine conflict because we got because now Russia is our top supplier of energy uh petroleum and we were initially getting the petrolum at very very discounted rates even now we are getting favorable rates not above the the the overall Global thing so and and this conflict the Ukraine conflict has actually brought India higher in stature because uh India is playing a significant role geopolitically uh not just as a mediator but also as a nation that Russia and the US are both wooing so the Russians need India as a as as a powerful large Nation like India if India is friendly with Russia and has maintains diplomatic relations and does not engage does not go along with the US sanctions on Russia that's a significant pressure release valve for Russia and India buying so much Russian oil also makes sure that Russia doesn't have to go entirely in the Chinese lap and become a Chinese vasal or Chinese pet so India is very important from Russia from that perspective and China is is the only major threat from Russia apart from the US because of the large shared border so India if India is gets more powerful then it's also good for Russia from that perspective so India is now playing a very Central role in geopolitics because of all these things the Americans want India on their side at least Visa China if not Visa Russia the Chinese are worried about India's rise and India becoming more and more p with the US so overall these conflicts have actually brought more attention on India and they have helped India rise to a significant top four position globally from the geopolitics perspective and obviously because of the rise of China and the threat of China lots of Nations have this China plus one policy which means that okay we are manufacturing most of our stuff in China but we need have we need to have a plus one nation and that Nation the only nation that can serve that role is India so you going to have semiconductor chips manufactured in India we're going to have all kinds of other stuff Manufacturing in India India is the number one destination globally now for fdis uh foreign direct in investment so India is going to rise as a manufacturing power as long as we play our cards well so India has benefited from the Ukraine conflict whether people realize it or not it's not like we wanted to benefit from it but when something happens you go to make the best of the the cards you are dealt and India has done that really well when it comes to the Gaza conflict it it it doesn't hurt India it doesn't benefit India it can hurt more than benefit India because if the conflict there's a big conflict duration in the West Asia region then our near abroad region gets destabilized it could affect the that the things the goods and whatever else is flowing into India India whether we know it or not depends on the sea a lot we are we have this gigantic Seaboard and we are a maritime Nation so much of our Imports especially oil energy all that come in from the sea and we don't want a disruption of all these Supply chains so if the West Asia region becomes really destabilized it could actually hurt India so that is our perspective on West Asia from the Ukraine perspective we have actually kind of benefited that's it's a one level deep answer uh if we see a conflict scaling up in the Gulf mhm if this Israel Iran thing actually scales up first of all do you think it will I hope not it doesn't look like it will it doesn't look right now okay that it will could any other conflict scale up uh yeah so the answer to the question is which are the most powerful nations in this region you have Israel the most powerful Nation despite being so small number two is let's say Iran number three is Saudi Arabia and then there's always the Spectre of turkey okay the shadow of turkey is always there but turkey is not that powerful a nation but extremely ambitious Mr erdogan would like to revive the otoman Empire yeah yeah he would like to do that he would like to do that going eastwards this time instead of going westwards the Ottoman Empire expanded westwards into Europe the new Ottoman Empire of Mr erdogan's dreams would like to expand eastwards and reconnect with the turkic nations of Central Asia the various Stans usbekistan T not Tajikistan apart from Tajikistan all the other nations are turkic nations Tajikistan is an indo-iranian Nation or they would say Iranian Nation iranic Nation so they the the Turks would like to reconnect all all of this and and wipe out Armenia from existence so I think overall if a major conflict erupts potentially in the Middle East it will definitely involve Israel the Saudis don't want to fight Israel the Saudis want peace with Israel the Saudis are want to focus on economic growth Beyond pet petroleum okay the UAE also wants peace in the region they don't want war they want growth and development and they want their economy to rise further so the Saudis and the UA they are so friendly with India for these reasons because India is a benign power it's a non-threatening power and India is such a economy with such a huge potential that the Saudis and the UA the emiratis can work with India in mutually beneficial ways and both economies can rise and we have the imch the India middle east Europe trade Corridor which was supposed to connect India with Greece and Europe why are the middle east region and the Saudis and the Emira emiratis were supposed to be involved but the Gaza conflict has kind of postponed the the the construction of this thing so if a major conflict invol erupts it's going to definitely involve Israel the Saudis would not want to fight Israel the emiratis would not want to fight Israel the Egyptians also would not want to fight Israel because they in no position to fight Israel because their econom is not doing well so who's left it's either Iran or turkey so that's what could happen if something does happen in the Middle East it's either Israel Iran Israel turkey or some combination of these factors okay or maybe the US does something stupid in the region because the US has a lot of control in the in the region they have lots of military base in in the region they wanted to take down the Syrian government is has not happened because of Mr Putin and they they have a very old Grudge to settle with Iran as well so the Americans if they do something in something very bright in the region That Could set off something but I don't hopefully it doesn't happen is one able to predict America's moves geopolitically speaking post World War II a post World War II the the moves were very predictable it was all predicated on on on containing Russia on containing the USSR and they were able to do it spectacularly well why did the USSR ultimately collapse it's because of the pressure built by the Americans who controlled all the sea Roots all the trade rules all the supply Supply chains the USSR controlled only the Eastern European nations the the wars so packed Nations and even the Chinese were on the US side eventually and they had no access to the warm Waters of the of the world ocean and they were cut off from the global Supply chains so the only thing that they had was their own nation which is an utari everything they can imagine can all the resources they can imagine are available in their own Nation because it's such a last such a vast land mass but they were not able to project power anywhere let's say they wanted to project power in in the South China see they could not do it project power in the Indian Ocean region they could do so to a certain extent but not much 71 was the last time they projected power and that's why India was able to bifurcate Pakistan and and give rise to Bangladesh because of Russian actions that offset the US bullying of India the Americans and the British had sent aircraft carrier strike groups in the Bay of Bengal to bully India and to allow the pakistanis to continue the genocide of Bengal Al Hindus in in East Pakistan but the Russians sent a nuclear submarine Fleet to face off against the British and the Americans and that's why India was able to liberate Bangladesh that is 71 what happens in 73 the US takes possession of Diego Garcia if you look at the lakad and maldiv Islands Maldives on on the North you have the lak islands a continuation of the same island chain is the Maldives and it culminates in the in the South with the chos islands which are illegally controlled by the British and they have given the island of Diego Garcia to the Americans where the Americans have a major Air Force Base Naval base and a very sophisticated network of Radars so they took control of this possession of this Americans in 1973 as a response to the debacle of 1971 where they could not bully India into letting the pakistanis continue their genocide so that is the situation right now uh so the Americans they they activities could be very easily understood during the Cold War era in the 20th century it was all about the competition with Russia with with the USSR and other nations that were friendly with the USSR like India so the indiaan so India was in the American bad books that's why they supported Pakistan so much that the Americans financed and funded Pakistani terrorism against Afghanistan and India for more than two decades until at least 2008 when the Mumbai attacks happened after that maybe it has gone below the surface to some extent but that's a deal in the 21st century the American actions are kind of more complicated on the one hand the nation they really fear is Russia but the nation against which they seem seemingly do their moves is China so they would like to use India as a counterbalance to China but India itself is a rising power in 20 years India could be the next China so they use Nations like Pakistan as a counterbalance to India so that's why Pakistan is so important again in the US eyes and even in the Chinese eyes so there is all these multiple layers of of compe and geopolitics happening the main threat for the US is Russia people think it's China but it's Russia Russia is the real hard power that the Americans fear and obviously there's this competition and collaboration with China the American economy and the Chinese economy are joined at the hip actually the Chinese have bought incredible amounts of US Treasury bonds so they own a lot of US debt and that means that the Americans eventually will have to repay the debt and if they don't repay the debt it means the US dollar is finished the US dollar and if the US dollar is finished it means the US is finished because that's that's all the US have the US superpower status is predicated on two things first their control of the global economy which is entirely based more or less on the US dollar being the reserve currency Global Reserve currency and secondly the power projection ability because they have more than 800 military bases American military bases Beyond American territory spread across the world these two factors have made the US the superpower if the US dollar collapses how will they sustain those 800 military bases and so on so forth so the US and China are joined at the hip the Chinese o a significant amount of US debt the Americans someday will have to pay it or they'll have to decide that they are no longer a superpower or not so there that's where we are it's very complicated in the 21st century much more complicated of course we have the benefit of hindsight to see the to see the Cold War of the 20th century we understand it very well similar things are happening right now but it's it's no longer a bipolar world the 20th century was a bipolar conflict the US versus the USSR after the second world war today you have a multi-polar world you have one single superpower you have a near superpow which is Russia you have a declining great power which is China and you have a rising middle power which is India and then you have Nations like France and turkey and Iran and Saudi Arabia Etc Indonesia in the mix which are kind of below the middle power status but which are going to rise if they do things properly almost at the end of this pacy geopolitical podcast sir but uh is there anything else you'd like to cover about just what's happening in the world right now because we're doing a podcast like this every 3 months now so Myanmar is that something you'd want to talk about Myanmar is a conflict no one talks about and it's a very important conflict and it's something that affects India directly and it affects India very badly so yeah let's talk about Myanmar Myanmar is Burma it used to be a part of the British Raj it's a nation that's culturally very close to India they are Buddhist they were Hindus in the past these nations Myanmar Thailand Indonesia all were part of extended India which some would call akan bat very very Indian in culture but of course ethnically very very diverse so Myanmar in 1935 they voted the government of Myanmar which was a puppet government of the British in 1935 they voted to remain a part of British India but the British forcibly cut Myanmar off from India so they Burma wanted to be part of India they wanted to continue being a part of India but the British cut that off now today you have a military government in Burma uh it's been in power essentially since the 1940s when the British left the place and it is not in control of the whole country Myanmar in the Northern parts of Myanmar you have all these different ethnic groups that are are non Burmese ethnic groups they don't speak the Burmese language they don't practice Burmese culture some of these ethnic groups like the cookies who are called the cookies they are converted to Christianity in recent times past 100 or so years they speak a language that is native to Yan in China and they are essentially Outsiders who are now control burm territory and they're fighting the burmes government so there is a civil war kind of situation happening there and that is pilling over into India so the state that everyone talks about because of what happened in the past year is Manipur Manipur the situation I mean it's a geopolitical situation which which people seem to think is a Law and Order issue in the 1980s and '90s the Americans used to say Jammu and Kashmir is an Indian Law and Order issue you people are not able to maintain Law and Order and that's why you have this thing happening when they were funneling Pakistan terrorists and arms and ammunition and weapons and money into Jammu and Kashmir to undermine the Indian government's control over its own territory the Americans were do doing that right now it looks like Manipur is a Law and Order issue it's again a geopolitic issue and it's being it's it's these terrorists these Outsiders these infiltrators who are being funneled into India into Manipur from across the border in Burma where the burmes government has lost control and you have the presence of various Western missionaries and various other things and Chinese arms and ammunition and weapons coming in so there is a drug angle there is a poppy angle the entire funding comes from selling drugs much of that was happening in Manipur as well until the government cracked down on it and some of it may still be happening and all the weapons that are coming in are coming in from China arms ammunition because China the Chinese border the Yan border is about 100 kilm 200 kmet away it's not really far it's very wooded and hilly region and all these weird you know disparate ethnic groups live here and Manipur Manipur lost control of its Destiny in the early 19th century when uh the burmes conquered Manipur the actual burmes Kingdom uh the burmes Empire conquered Manipur it was a seven years of Devastation of Manipur in which Manipur had to face lots of atrocities when the burmes left uh the Manipur king of Manipur had to bring in the British as as the guaran of security and once the British enter the the region the the scene they mess everything up so Manipur lost sovereignty the British instituted they they forced the king of Manipur to have a British political officer in the court and then they were forced to start bringing in these Outsiders into Manipur territory and settling there there who are the cookies but around 1900 less than 1% of the population of Manipur was cookies today it's Manipur is overwhelmed with cookies and even after 1947 after 1949 when Manipur becomes a part of India the Indian government continued the same British policies of bringing in foreigners these these burmes origin the people who who are on the other side of the border into Manipur is as refugees I don't know for what reason and what has now happened is that the southern portion of Manipur more than 50% of the territory is now under the control of these Outsiders these infiltrators okay and uh over the past 10 years thousands of new Villages are visible in satellite images and maybe a million or so people must have infiltrated into into India from across the border now is it the government's fault no it is the fault of previous governments who did not ever fence the border and there was this open border regime that India and Burma had signed that the Border will remain open and people will have the right to move across the border for a certain amount of time and a certain amount of of kilometers so because of that these people have been able to infiltrate million close to a million people into India and the native Manipur is the people who speak the manipuri language which has been around for 2,000 years and who have always ruled Manipur they now occupy less than 7% of the of their ancestral territories so that's the deal that's what's happening in Manipur the the so-called cookies they have ethnically cleansed out the nagas the the mes of Manipur and they are still pouring on pouring in across the border from Burma the government of Burma has lost control there is a civil war kind of situation and there is the involvement of Western missionaries very strongly in the anti- burmes government efforts and there is the involvement of China as well China also would like to take advantage of the situation and who is suffering the people of Burma are suffering and the people of India especially Manipur are suffering so what is the solution to this the solution is very simple all the outsiders all the foreigners have to be sent back repatriated either to Burma or to Yan or wherever else not in India and the Native Indians have to be given their lands back but that is easier said than done because what about the records the Census records the everybody has AAR cards once you have an AAR card you have an election card and the these so-called cookie people they are classified as s scheduled tribes so they get preferential treatment they become is officers ifs officers not ifs even ifs I'm sure so they get and and the native M People of Manipur they are General category so they what do what do they get they get nothing they don't get any good jobs or anything these people get uh free I don't know all kinds of benefits you know reservation benefits and they also get get high ranking positions in the in the government of India so that is the situation right now and it is all happening because of the instability in Burma across the border once again there's the golden triangle angle which is a drugs angle uh Burma Thailand and Cambodia these regions have historically been the Golden Triangle where all these narcotics come from because Poppy opium and various other you know plants are grown there which are then processed and refined through chemical processes into heroine cocaine and whatnot mainly heroin and heroin derivative substances and that has devastated the northeast of India in the 1970s and 80s also and we are seeing for some time Manipur was doing well and then this whole problem erupted in May last year so it is not a Law and Order issue it's a geopolitical issue it is a continuation of efforts from outside of India from the west of India Far West let's say to keep on applying the pain and pressure on India so that India doesn't have the chance to have you know unbroken growth there'll always be pressure points applied on India that's the deide now because where there's chaos there'll be economic fueling yeah that's effectively the geopolitical logic that money will be fueled in that direction and therefore it affects the money that would have been reinvested in a nation's growth yes you could have had a growth over here you could have economies and and businesses and Commercial activities that could have erupt that that could have grown very smoothly in the Far East of India in Manipur and other places but now you have the strife and all that money has to be used in just maintaining some some kind of Law and Order and there's daily terrorist attacks on on civilians and on government forces just a couple of days ago some crpf people were killed by The Outsiders by the forign refugees so-called and so on so this is a situation that's going on eventually it will take maybe 20 30 years to have some kind of solution to this problem it is not something we will be able to solve next week or next month or next year it's a demographic issue more about a million Outsiders have come and sett settled down and squatted in Indian Territory because of the actions of the previous governments of the past 50 70 years who kept the Border open now we are going to fence the Border it's going to take at least 10 years it is extremely wooded and hilly this area and then you'll have to man The Border just the way we man the India Pakistan border it's going to take a long time to do this by the time I I don't know how many more foreigners will infiltrate into India big big problem for India another use case for drones maybe maybe but when you have thick forest cover even drones may not be that useful but yeah some use for sure yeah big problem right now and no immediate solution yeah uh again I think the core aspects that we wanted to convey to the audience have now been conveyed it's a bit of a geopolitical update this year seems like it's going to be much more than what we call a flasho so this is the stuff that's going on before things escalate according to me uh I don't know if that's a too cinematic a thing to say or not but that's what I feel is there any signing of note you have from a geopolitical perspective yeah this is a pivotal year geopolitically elections in some of the most important nations in the world the Indian general elections are going on right now as we speak uh June sometime in June we will know who's the next prime minister whether Mr Modi continues or whether there is some very unexpected change so I will not tell the people whom to vote for but there you have it so there's India and then there's the US elections which are going to happen in November this year and the results will be out pretty soon so that's also a very important election uh Russia already happened Pakistan the fake elections happened and Mr Sharif came to power and Indonesia and so on and males also happened elections happened and it was a Ste victory for Mr muuu who is anti- India so it's a pivotal year an year of Elections things could change globally but yeah the overall the temperature geopolitically over time is rising and that's not good for the stability of the world and for the economic order but that's where we are we are living in interesting times and the Chinese have this saying may you live in interesting times as a curse so maybe we are living in a cursed time AC another great episode thank you probably our 25th or 30th episode by this point so appreciate your presence always don't need to say that thank you so much thank you thank you so much that was the episode for today ladies and gentlemen right after the recording of this episode we also did a history special with AC that one was centered around Alexander the Great and chenis Khan I adore history episodes I love doing geopolitics episodes but history episodes are extremely special so when it comes to AC the one thing I'd like for you guys to tell us is what other aspects of History would you like to learn with the great man abijit chav has completed yet another shoot with us there's another episode that's coming your way but for now both AC and ra will be back on TRS very very very soon
